### Explain in your own words, what is the Hypothesis Testing Methodology?

As it is often done in statistics, the conclusions about the whole population of the data
are based on one or multiple samples. Not only because the data is scarce but also because
statistical science assume that hidden processes generating the data of a population are
the same as one generating samples of that population.

Hypothesis Testing is a classical approach in statistics used to infer the true nature
of the analyzed data: its distribution and underlying parameters 
(mean, variance, skewness and so on).

It is done by comparing 2 or more hypothesis (hence the name of the method).
One hypothesis is considered as default one (Null hypothesis) and all the others are
alternatives. If some of alternative hypothesis manages to be accepted it becomes a new
Null hypothesis. If none of alternative hypothesis is accepted, then the Null hypothesis
is considered as the true one (with a certain level of confidence, typically 95%, or 
5% error).

Knowing the nature of the data is useful in many ways: predictions, anomaly detection,
data simulation and so on.
